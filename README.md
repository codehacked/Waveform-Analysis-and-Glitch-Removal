**Waveform Analysis and Glitch Removal** involves scrutinizing signal waveforms to identify and address glitchesâ€”brief, unintended deviations that can disrupt signal integrity. This process includes detailed examination of waveform characteristics such as timing, amplitude, and shape to spot irregularities. Techniques such as filtering, signal conditioning, or circuit modifications are then employed to eliminate or reduce these glitches, ensuring the signal is stable, clean, and accurate for reliable system performance.
